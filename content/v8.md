In a recent fit of inspiration, I channeled my new passion for Clojure to redesign and rebuild my website. I wanted to keep the design as simple and readable as possible, an homage to minimalist unstyled html.

The new version is built with [Perun](https://perun.io/), a [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) library for generating static sites with [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/). Content is written in Markdown and rendered with composable functions that return [Hickup vectors](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup).

Thanks to [boot-reload](https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-reload), I live coded both design and content with Atom and Chrome in split screen - a very fun and productive workflow.

Finally, I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the site. On every push to a pull request or branch, a perpetual immutable deployment, with its own url, is built with Boot in a Docker container.

**To deploy changes to production, I simply merge into master.**

If you are interested in reading the source or want to fork the website for your own purposes, an MIT-licensed empty version is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/adamrenklint/blank-website).
